            <p>Last Updated: January 15, 2021</p>

            <p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
            <p>THE AFFIRMXH SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AffirmXH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY AffirmXH ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. AffirmXH MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE AffirmXH SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AffirmXH SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE AffirmXH SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>

            <p>TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, AffirmXH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. AffirmXH DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE AffirmXH SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AffirmXH SERVICES, AffirmXH'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM AffirmXH ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, AffirmXH WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY AffirmXH SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY OF THE AffirmXH SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.</p>


            <h2>DISPUTES</h2>
            <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any of the AffirmXH Services, or to any products or services sold or distributed by AffirmXH will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>

            <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>

            <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.</p>

            <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>


            <h2>APPLICABLE LAW</h2>
            <p>By using any AffirmXH Services, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and AffirmXH.</p>

            <p>The AffirmXH Services are controlled, operated and administered by AffirmXH from offices within the USA. If you access AffirmXH Services from a location outside the USA, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws. You agree that you will not use the content accessed through the AffirmXH Services in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws, restrictions or regulations.</p>


            <h2>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</h2>
            <p>Please review our other policies posted on the AffirmXH Website. These policies also govern your use of AffirmXH Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our AffirmXH Website, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>
